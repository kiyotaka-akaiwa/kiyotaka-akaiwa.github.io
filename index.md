## Who am I

I am a student at El Camino College studying Computer Information Systems, trying to get into the field of cybersecurity.
I speak Japanese and English fluently.

I am a member of a CTF team [CyberSpace](https://ctftime.org/team/116280/), but I play CTF on my own as well ([kiyotakaakaiwa](https://ctftime.org/team/181501)).

My [GitHub](https://github.com/kiyotaka-akaiwa) contains my CTF writeups as well as my reading lists and my projects.
